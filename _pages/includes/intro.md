I am a third-year M.Eng. student in the [Key Laboratory of Autonomous Intelligent Unmanned Systems(AIUS)](https://aius.hit.edu.cn/) at **Harbin Institute of Technology** (HIT, China).

I am broadly interested in **Embodied AI** and **Robotics**. My current research focuses on **Reinforcement Learning**, **Deep Learning** and **Robotics**. I am particularly interested in TODO.

If you are interested in any form of academic collaboration, please feel free to email me at [chentingjia1209@163.com](mailto:chentingjia1209@163.com).
